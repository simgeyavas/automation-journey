    /*The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.
    Roll the die for the user (generate a Random number between 1 – 6) and advance the user that number of spaces on the game board.
    Random random = new Random();
    int die = random.nextInt(6) + 1;
    After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win.
    Repeat this 4 additional times, for 5 rolls in total.
    However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - they’ve won.
    If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.
    Remember there are only 20 spaces on the board, so a message like “You advanced to space 22” is a bug.*/
